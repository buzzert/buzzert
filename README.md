# James Magahern (buzzert)

Greetings! My account consists primarily of my personal projects, born out of a need for something to exist, or just for fun. Some of the things you'll find here are Linux desktop applications and customizations, home automation tools, embedded projects, and lots of other random things.

I'm really passionate about [free software](https://www.fsf.org/), so most of the code that I write is licensed under GPL. 

## Future Projects on Sourcehut

GitHub feels more and more like a social network these days, with a lot of people gaming it for attention. For this reason (and to support free software), most of my newer projects are on [SourceHut](https://sr.ht), which itself is AGPL/BSD. 

My SourceHut profile is here: [sr.ht/~buzzert](https://git.sr.ht/~buzzert)
